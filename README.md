OVERVIEW of the Project:
Project: Temperature Conversion Program

Purpose
  The program is designed to convert temperatures between three common scales: Celsius (C), Fahrenheit (F), and Kelvin (K). Users can input a temperature value and specify the current scale, and the program will convert it to the desired scale.

Key Components
Conversion Functions:

  -Celsius to Fahrenheit: Converts a Celsius temperature to Fahrenheit.
  -Celsius to Kelvin: Converts a Celsius temperature to Kelvin.
  -Fahrenheit to Celsius: Converts a Fahrenheit temperature to Celsius.
  -Fahrenheit to Kelvin: Converts a Fahrenheit temperature to Kelvin.
  -Kelvin to Celsius: Converts a Kelvin temperature to Celsius.
  -Kelvin to Fahrenheit: Converts a Kelvin temperature to Fahrenheit.
  -Conversion Logic: The convert_temperature function uses conditional statements to determine which conversion to perform based on the input and desired output scales. It also checks for valid input scales and prints an error message if the scale is invalid.

User Interaction: The main function handles user input and output:

  Prompts the user to enter a temperature value.
  Asks for the scale of the input temperature.
  Asks for the scale to convert to.
  Calls the convert_temperature function to perform the conversion and display the result.
Example Workflow
  User is prompted to enter a temperature value (e.g., 25).
  User specifies the scale of the input value (e.g., C for Celsius).
  User specifies the scale they want to convert to (e.g., F for Fahrenheit).
  The program calculates the equivalent temperature and displays it (e.g., 25.00 C is equal to 77.00 F).
Error Handling
  The program checks for invalid scale inputs and provides appropriate feedback if the user enters an unrecognized scale.

Conclusion
  This temperature conversion program is a straightforward and effective way to handle temperature conversions. It demonstrates basic programming concepts such as functions, conditional logic, and user input handling in C. The code is structured to be easily extensible if you wish to add more features or conversion scales in the future.
